# 📊 Telecom Customer Churn Analysis

This project performs an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a telecom customer churn dataset using Python. The aim is to understand what factors contribute to customer attrition and offer data-driven insights for retention strategies.

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset includes 7,043 customer records with 21 features covering:
- Demographics (gender, senior citizen status, dependents)
- Service usage (internet, phone, streaming)
- Contract and billing details
- Churn label (Yes/No)

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## 📌 Key Features
- Cleaned and preprocessed data (handled blanks and data types)
- Visualized churn patterns with bar plots, histograms, and pie charts
- Analyzed service-based churn tendencies (e.g., TechSupport, OnlineSecurity)
- Identified impact of contract length, payment methods, and tenure
- Compiled findings into a professional PDF report

## 📈 Summary Insights
- ~26.5% of customers have churned.
- Senior citizens, short-tenure users, and electronic check payers are more likely to churn.
- Month-to-month contracts have the highest churn rates (~40%).
- Longer contracts and service bundling reduce churn risk significantly.

## 📄 Report
An executive summary PDF has been included for presentation and stakeholder communication.
